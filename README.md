# Inventory Stock Level Prediction using Machine Learning

Trained a machine learning model to predict inventory stock levels using forecasting models such as ARIMA. "An ARIMA model is a statistical analysis model that leverages time series data to forecast future trends". 
The project also uses traditional regression models such as Linear, SVR, KNN and Decision Trees for metrics comparison.
